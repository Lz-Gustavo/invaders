#Invaders Game - Built using Godot Game Engine

    Sample project of a 2D space shooter game aimed to be a practical application of design patterns in source development.
    Patterns applied on the game development:
	
	->Creational:
	    *Factory
	
	->Structural:
	    *Adapter

	->Behavioral:
	    *Template
	    *MVC (not from GoF)

#To run the project you must follow these steps:

    1) install Mono environment

	Ubuntu/Debian one line command:
		sudo apt-get update & sudo apt-get install mono-devel

    2) set up godot game engine by one of these methods:
	
	--> compile the source code in: /invaders/libs-godot/ following the guide 
	avaiable at: http://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.0/development/compiling/compiling_with_mono.html

	--> download the pre-compile version with C# support at: https://godotengine.org/download/linux

    3) open the project inside /invaders/game/
