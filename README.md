## Patterns applied on the game development
	
### Creational:
* Factory

### Structural:
* Adapter

### Behavioral:
* Template
* MVC (not from GoF)

Game executables are avaiable for Windows10 and Ubuntu_x86_64 at /dist folder.

## Prerequisites

### Install Mono environment

	Ubuntu/Debian one line command:
	
	```
		sudo apt-get update & sudo apt-get install mono-devel
	```

### Set up godot game engine by one of these methods:
	
* compile the source code in: /invaders/libs-godot/ following the guide avaiable at: http://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.0/development/compiling/compiling_with_mono.html

* download the pre-compile version with C# support: https://godotengine.org/download/linux

### Open the project file inside /invaders/game/
